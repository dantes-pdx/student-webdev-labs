## Reflection Document

### HTML

HTML is much more straight forward than css

### Accessibility

I made the html files as accessible as possible but sometimes its can
be more of a balance act of making the webpage as exact as provided
in reference photo and the accessible. Only Exercise 6 was the accessiblity
vs html likeness a problem for me (I sided with HTML likeness to image references).

### CSS

CSS is much more complicated than the HTML format. With more practice and artistic
touch would I feel comfortable working on front end design.
