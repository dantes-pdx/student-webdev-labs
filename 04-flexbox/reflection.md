## Reflection Document

### HTML

I commented out all flex-box class except the 1st.

### Accessibility

I only had to change this line:

<h1>Flex Container</h1> to get it to pass all Wave acessability issues.

### CSS

I used css exculsively for this flexbox lab and commented out all css code except the exercise in question while completing this lab. I had a lot of trial and error and I relize that renderings may vary depending on screen size's but all exercise look almost identical to the provided solution images.
